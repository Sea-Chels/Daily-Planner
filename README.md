## Description
For this project the point was to get more practice using moment.js. I can't say it was my favorite thing in the world, it was a learning curve to get things working just right, and it was a quite a challenging proccess. And unlike my last project, where I mostly followed a tutorial, I wrote most of the javascript myself this time, which I have to say I'm pretty proud of. Although I did get the modal js from w3 schools. Thanks w3 schools. I did deviate a bit from the example shown to us for the project, but that's because I wanted to challenge myself, I also didn't like the way it looked. I can't say I'm perfectly happy with the way mine looks, so I'm going to come back to this at some point and make this ux/ui better and more user-friendly. 

The two things I struggled with the most on this project were gathering data in a way that was easy to translate to the user, and then being able to compare that data to moment's parsing and way of understanding information, but after a session with my tutor that was a quick fix. The second thing I had the most trouble with was appending things from local storage. Honestly at the point in which I'm writing this read me, I am still struggling with this feature, I'm sure at some point I will get this fixed though before turning this in though. Lets hope.

The problem that this application is trying to solve is the the user's time management problems.
